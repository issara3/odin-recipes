    <h2>What is Pad Thai?</h2>

    <p> What is pad Thai? A popular dish whose name means “Thai stir-fry,” pad Thai is a stir-fry of rice noodles, eggs, tofu, and meat, with a sweet-sour-salty and slightly spicy sauce, and toppings of peanuts, fresh vegetables, and cilantro — sometimes served on the side. Pad Thai sauce often contains dried shrimp and fish sauce (which you cannot really taste). At first pad Thai might not sound like something from your comfort zone, but the final result is a toothsome noodle dish that's as tasty as they come.</p>
    <p>Pad Thai emerged in Thailand in the mid-20th century, incorporating elements and techniques borrowed from Chinese cuisine. It was declared a Thai national dish around the time of World War II and quickly grew in popularity. Today, pad Thai is perhaps more popular than ever, both as a common street food in its native land and in Thai restaurants around the world.</p>
