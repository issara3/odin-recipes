    <h2>What is Drunken Noodle?</h2>
    <p>Drunken Noodles is the literal translation of Pad Kee Mao because the theory is that these spicy Thai noodles should be eaten with an ice cold beer and that they are a great cure for hangover. I can confirm both cases to be true!</p>
    <p>The dish is widely available in restaurants or at street vendors in Thailand but it is also highly popular in the United States, and has become ubiquitous on Thai restaurant menus throughout. Despite its name, alcohol is not one of the ingredients.</p>
